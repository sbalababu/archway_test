## 2.1.3

- Don't show cluster status, it is difficult for users to interpret. 72f134b3cb15fe8b99a02cf600780e1b56bd393e

## 2.1.2

### Bug Fixes

- Fix change-owner functionality to properly add new owner to workspace. 66484e23d9b87cb60de6495999fbbdcf5cca28ee

## 2.1.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fix a bug where users who were not in both risk and ops groups were denied permission to see workspaces.

## 2.1.0

### Enhancements

- Restyled workspace 'Wecome' email.
- Add a workspace 'hide' button in the workspace 'manage' section. This is a replacement for the crazy deletion scripts that were buggy. The hide button does a logical delete of the workspace so it is ignored in workspace listings. It deletes no data. A workspace can optionally be 'deprovisioned' before it is hidden to remove resources like AD groups and hive databases. 509c24186de7747dd63ed3ce864f76b1524c18d3
- Ability to change workspace owners in the 'manage' section.
- Send the log file back to phData using the 'support bundle' role command in the server role. 090fe04943319dfdc87f0c773df6f1e86357702e
- AD Group synchronization. Archway keeps track of Active directory groups in its own database for performance reasons.
  Previously, if a user was removed from AD outside of Archway, the user would still show up as a member of a workspace in
  the Archway UI. Now, if a user is removed from AD or an Archway AD group they will be removed from the Archway database and
  UI. In addition, if a user is added to an Archway managed AD group, they will automatically be added to the Archway database and
  UI. Synchronizing groups runs as a scheduled job every 2 hours by default. d814a3d718ec8ee1f0a25d995f4bbf2c26af4c5b
- Mask all passwords in the UI. It was possible for passwords to be printed to the UI during debug logging, this has been fixed and
  now when a password would have been displayed '**\*\*\***' will be displayed in its place. 839e118c2e7f4ef29fa3ee20beaa0d3dbdfd6bf8
- The 'Add Member' button in a workspace is now greyed out until the workspace is provisioned. 1e4c66e6768fbbde33eb7806be9c176d6ef79532
- Modify the 'MEMBER ID SEARCH' box to show the user id first in the auto-completeion. 7fb08124eb8b899883a4c6f9c35c57ec4d7850d0
- Option added for 'smtps' in addition to SSL. 2ba2e7f359f9f7bc963f8401b3d0ef3e1d06c4f8

## Bug fixes

- Make LDAP lookup bindings optional. Previously functionality was added to automatically fall back to the provisioning bindings
  if no lookup bindings were provided, but CM was still asking for lookup bindings to be provided. This has been corrected. 46cfd972a3a1244b26375aeac0f610989efe9d59
- Fix a bad logging message where the 'from' address was being logged as the 'to' address in email notifications. ad8a2523c06aa1fd572ee2859d97c87fd0ba5ec5
- Reflect actual number of partitions in the UI when the minimum partition (3) is used. cac1b09adfab6e998a39e8520c32ea9eef1e2c21
- Clean up all temporary tables after they are used (heimdali_temp). 2f776f16445298b12b308ce822f4ba98dadfa939
- '/clusters' endpoint now requires authentication. 2a6117fb471c9020dae743847b2e000b0e35087c

## 2.0.0

### Enhancements

- Rename to Archway. ef7c086e18f14af03cb5b6e2bd999b481f02aafd
- Add a spinner in the user workspace member add search bar. 6ec147f78cf81e236c7bf7ae5e1d9741bb8e8ca2
- Handle database creation/updates automatically on application start. There is no longer a need to download
  any special packages (flyway) or run a role command. 11272d43c4a11a105d4830a5309616d9f2274570
- Validate all templates, including custom templates, on startup. dca69a9715f02487be6cda64b66d9e55553c50c0

### Bug Fixes

- Users are now blocked from viewing workspaces that they aren't a member of. 2f07a16ec01e8b38fe519edd27f75a2ae3fcda64

### Breaking Changes

With the renaming, Archway 2.0.0 introduces a new kerberos principal name, so permissions will need to be added to the cluster for the 'archway' user
in place of the 'heimdali_api' user. See the Archway install doc for details

Templates will also need to be modified, replacing the package names at the head of the file 'com.heimdali' with 'io.phdata'.

All data created by Archway, workspaces, and the 'heimdali' database are fully compatible with Archway 2.0

## 1.7.2

- Fix bug where the UI would fail if a user didn't have a kafka topic. d2851bc290263c6d5d11a75e83b6bb9fc146b550
- Added full http client request logging when 'TRACE' logging is enabled. 42958024ebe90483a335911d2584b7c90347995f

- Fix bug where yarn node manager and resource manager links would fail causing the all cluster info to fail. c74955361a62c9655324257593de6571434655d1

## 1.7.0

### Enhancements

- The 'Cluster Status' icon now links directly to CM so you can immediately satisfy your curiosity when there is a
  bad CM health status. ef2f0f3e3a40f075688419451f39ec7bab536ca9
- Custom Templates can now be added to the template root dir under the 'custom' folder. Custom templates will
  show as another option on the workspace request 'Behavior' page. See 'Breaking Changes' below for instructions on creating a custom template and modifying existing templates. 9f0d4415fbbe5cf0903fec540f238d2b79c15933
- Package the Impala JDBC driver with the application. It is no longer to download the Impala driver and add it to
  the classpath manually. 8a8d63c539c04bcb50d85c8eaaa9ab8783ffd298
- Add the database migration 'flyway' command as a role command. Before installing the service for the first time,
  and when there are database migrations, run the 'Migrate Database' command. e4f6c93056c15822e3e13e847826fe55e175149c
- Add 'heimdali.additional.java.options' safety valve style parameter to the service for adding additional Java options
  to the service. fe6262993572bd30a3c06a8f84b0069f9329c981
- Show a workspace status of either 'provisioning' or 'pending' that is linked to the actual provisioning status of
  the workspace. The old 'READY' icon in the upper left of the workspaces has been removed, it was only tied to workspace approvals and could be misleading about the status of a workspace. c805625825c5500e6069e9011de6dcbe4025dc37
- Verify database connection during Heimdali startup for faster fail and easier debugging of configuration. 7c0848dfdabb3be65f0b6a55dc356e851088d18e
- Add a 'MANAGE' tab to the workspace details page. the Manage tab has 'provision' and 'deprovision' buttons.
  'Deprovision' is an experimental feature, it may not deprovision all resources in your workspace. 039d265ef6145f2e915a260d1ee8909f8fab9f25
- Add validation for SMTP authentication settings: If you choose authenticated SMTP but don't set the username
  and application the application will fail on startup. 3aba1a503065a02113225959edc95a5cb3b4a4a6
- Add Oracle database support. Oracle database support is handled automatically by the application 'Database Migration'
  command, no steps are necessary except setting the correct connection string, driver, username, and password for your Oracle database. 9e8d76ed6725814e68e475720721f6be3d0f27e3
- Dynamically generate the application copyright year. 93b08baf5e612601f82ab99a5219491b34b640e5
- Pull yarn ports from Cloudera Manager instead of the hadoop config files. ffd21b3be690de4cd73a4fd831de755ec9c899eb

  will be used. e407508fb7c1de23f59b2abf99380df4a9a45d3b

### Bug Fixes

- When adding a member to a workspace, users are checked for exsitence in Active Directory before the user is added to
  the workspace. There is a spinner that shows until this check is completed and the user is added to the workspace
- Fix noisy http4s client error messages. abee7743f1e10ac23a52dcce8a1299dccb1d74b2
- Remove CORS headers. 85d0a585bcc903a790ac5dfd6ad3b862d3f58008

## CSD Upgrade Note

A CSD upgrade should not be necessary, but since there are so many documentation and usability improvements updating the CSD is recommended

### Breaking Changes

**Template Changes**
You must update existing templates to contain a 'metadata' block. If you do not update this block, your current templates 'user.ssp', 'structured.ssp', and 'simple.ssp' will fail to work. The metadata block descriptions are not important and the values do not need to be customized at this time.

A metadata block looks like this:

```
  "metadata": {
    "name": "${template.name}",
    "description": "${template.description}",
    "ordering": 1,
    "tags": {}
  },
```

A full template example can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/phdata/heimdali/src/8f588dadbc60b04bbfcc1c5a71b40c6626fb3464/templates/src/main/ssp/default/simple.ssp#lines-6

- Allow a comma separated list of approvers to be notified when a workspace is requested
- Automatically pull the value for the nameservice `dfs.nameservice` from the hadoop configuration
- UI: Clicking the main logo redirects to the home screen
- Automatically create user home dir when they request a personal workspace or are added to a workspace. f3bda9be12e771474da1d816e2ca8a75ab052dc4, HEIM-243 (pull request #51)
- Added the ability to export and import workspaces via json. df0dd19065afb6d959b4e4e57a7adba644db0c63, HEIM-130 (pull request #23)
